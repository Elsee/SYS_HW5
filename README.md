1. My partner is Fedor Berezyuk
2. I collected data from gyroscope and wheels encoders. The trajectory is the following: robot turns to the left on 60 degrees, moves forward about 0.5m, turns 120 degrees to the right, moves forward about 0.5m, turns 120 degrees to the right, moves forward about 0.5m, turns 120 degrees to the right, moves forward about 0.5m, makes right rotations (around 2 rotations). (File name: toPartner.csv)
3. I constructed path using data from wheels encoders. The result can be seen on picture "pathWithoutKalman.jpg" in the root directory. To run code you should open position.py in some python framework (Spyder, for examle) and run it. You will see path and rotations graphics using gyro data and calculated theta.
